# Some-ML-Excersises
Practicing and playing with ML and data manipulation in Python.

This repository is my first attempt in ML-world and it will include some projects that I'll do for practice. Probably i do projects from some online courses and famous ML examples.

The goal is to do a "ML in finance" project for university. I Already have some ideas :))
